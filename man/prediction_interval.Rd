\title{Point estimate function and confidence intervals for football predictions}
\usage{
prediction_interval(data, estimate, teamname, method = "future")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Output of \code{\link[amateuR]{all_game_data}} with parameter \code{team = NA}}

\item{estimate}{Output of \code{\link[amateuR]{estimate_params}} using the same data}

\item{teamname}{The name of the team of interest as a string}

\item{method}{Optional parameter which takes the values \code{"all"}, \code{"past"} or \code{"future"} to filter predictions}
}
\value{
A description of the columns of prediction data frames, \emph{upcoming} and \emph{future}:
\tabular{ll}{
 \code{Home L} \tab Lower bound of confidence interval for the predicted number of goals scored by the \emph{home team} \cr
 \code{Home Estimate} \tab Prediction of the number of goals scored by the \emph{home team}, rounded to one decimal point \cr
 \code{Home U} \tab Upper bound of confidence interval for the predicted number of goals scored by the \emph{home team} \cr
 \code{} \tab \cr
 \code{Away L} \tab Lower bound of confidence interval for the predicted number of goals scored by the \emph{away team} \cr
 \code{Away Estimate} \tab Prediction of the number of goals scored by the \emph{away team}, rounded to nearest integer \cr
 \code{Away U} \tab Upper bound of confidence interval for the predicted number of goals scored by the \emph{away team} \cr
 \code{} \tab \cr
 \code{Note H} \tab The number of stars indicate the width of the confidence interval for the \emph{home team}. The more stars the larger the interval \cr
 \code{Note A} \tab The number of stars indicate the width of the confidence interval for the \emph{away team}. The more stars the larger the interval \cr
 \code{Predicted result} \tab Home and away intervals are compared and H,D,A is returned based on the prediction \cr
 \code{Final Score} \tab For a completed match the final full time score is given here

\description{
This function returns point estimates and a confidence interval for the number of home and away goals scored in a match.
